# Hello World
Welcome to my web page. Fun facts: This is hosted on an ESP8266!

## WebSticks
The WebStick is an Arduino programmed, mini web server stick power in a USB drive form factor.

You might be wonder how it is possible to work right? Well, it is not simple. The make it work, I first
need to write a web server in C++ and make it serve html files from an SD card formated as FAT.
Next, I need to handle all kind of headers and werid things to make it happens.
